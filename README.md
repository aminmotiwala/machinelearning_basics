# Machine Learning with Google Colab

Welcome to my machine learning repository, where I share code, experiments, and projects using Google Colab. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with hands-on examples, tutorials, and machine learning projects to help you learn and explore various aspects of machine learning.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks focusing on machine learning concepts, algorithms, and projects implemented using Google Colab. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with machine learning or an experienced practitioner exploring new techniques, you'll find something valuable here.

## Notebook Structure

The notebooks are organized into different directories based on topics, algorithms, or projects. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained with clear explanations, code snippets, and visualizations.

## Dependencies

The notebooks are organized into different directories based on topics, algorithms, or projects. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained with clear explanations, code snippets, and visualizations.

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
